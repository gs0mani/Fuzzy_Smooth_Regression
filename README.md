# Fuzzy_Smooth_Regression
*Note: This is just a demo implementation for the concept of fuzzy regression using same points in fuzzy-plane geometry*<br/>
As fuzzy regression is closely associated with fuzzy line and curve ﬁtting, a given set of fuzzy points can be observed as a collection of same points with varied membership values. Hence, collectively, the problem of identifying a fuzzy regression curve can be tackled by  using conventional regression curves for each set of same points with diﬀerent membership.
